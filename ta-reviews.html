									<p>PHYS 1C - Waves, Optics & Modern Physics (Arnold, Kam S)
                                        Spring 2021
                                        Number of Evaluations Submitted: 32
                                        Number of Students Enrolled: 936
                                        "Courtney answers student's questions effectively and clearly. She helped my understanding of
                                        the course material a lot. She guides students to the correct answer. She is always willing to
                                        clarify if something is not clear. She is committed to helping students understand the course
                                        material."</p>
                                    <p>"Courtney is really passionate and makes going to discussion more engaging."</p>
                                    <p>"Courtney was such a big help in this class!! She really furthered my understanding of the lecture
                                        material and homework questions. She was always willing to answer my questions and provide
                                        me with clarification. I genuinely would have struggled a lot more in this course if it weren't for
                                        Courtney's weekly problem sessions."</p>
                                    <p>"I was unable to attend the "TA sessions" that were available to us but the meetings were
                                        recorded and Courtney's explanation for the homework/concept questions that students had
                                        were clear and helpful. She also replied to emails/messages quickly when asked. Being one of
                                        two TAs for a class that had like 900 students, I think she did an exceptional job." 
                                        "Courtney really did such an amazing job explaining homework questions clearly. I understood
                                        things so much better after listening to her explanations, and she genuinely always wanted to
                                        help us students. She was always patient!"</p> 
                                    <p>"Courtney was a great TA for both Phys1B and Phys1C and I really learned a great deal from her!"
                                    </p>
                                    <p>"PHYS 1B - Electricity and Magnetism (Groisman, Alexander)
                                        Winter 2021
                                        Number of Evaluations Submitted: 26

									<p>"Her notes were great. I read through them before tests. They were an excellent recap before
                                        tests."</p>
                                    <p>"Courtney actually helped me learn the material in this course. She explained concepts really well
                                        and lead great problems sessions."</p>
                                    <p>"Courtney is such a kind and caring person. She is great at answering questions and is willing to
                                        go through a concept multiple times until we all understand it. You can truly tell how passionate
                                        Courtney is about Physics and she always has a smile on her face."</p>
                                    <p>"Courtney makes difficult concepts a lot easier to understand by providing multiple examples and
                                        explaining it until we all understand in office hours. She is the best TA I have ever had and
                                        makes the course material exciting and interesting."</p>
                                    <p>"Courtney’s problem sessions were so helpful for me throughout the quarter. She was always so
                                        positive and didn’t make me ever feel bad for needing her to repeat an explanation or describe
                                        how she got to the answer. I really appreciated that she was willing to go over homework
                                        questions without just telling us the answer or exactly how to finish every question so that we
                                        could use our understanding to arrive at the solutions."</p>
                                    <p>"Very nice and made concise explanations. Would love to have her as a TA in the future."</p>
                                    <p>"Courney has been crucial in making this experience taking PHYS 1AL a positive one. She breaks
                                        down difficult problems and assists students in their thinking towards solving those problems.
                                        She is very respectful and always excited to help students in every office hour."</p>
                                    <p>"Courtney was one of the best TA's I have ever had. She explained concepts/problems in a way
                                        that was clear and really got me to think about the bigger picture. I had not taken a physics
                                        class before and her explanations really helped me understand the lab and lecture material. She
                                        is a natural at teaching and I wish I could have her again!"</p>
                                    <p>"I was diagnosed with COVID and was not able to get an extension for my lab. Courtney went
                                        beyond her responsibilities to meet with me separately on Zoom to help me understand
                                        concepts for that lab better since I was mentally and physically exhausted. I really appreciate
                                        her help and support that I received during that time."</p>
                                    <p>"Thank you for this quarter. The office hour sessions really helped with my lab assignments and I
                                        was able to wrap my head around a lot of concepts."</p>
                                    <p>"Gave clear and concise explanations. Made complicated/difficult material significantly easier to
                                        understand. Really tried to engage students and get us to think about the importance of physics
                                        overall."</p>
                                    <p>"Courtney was really clear about her expectations from us and our work. She worked really hard
                                        to create a welcoming environment where students could speak up, ask their questions, and
                                        clarify their understanding. She also emphasized that she really wants us to understand what is
                                        happening/what we are learning, so that we could always ask her for clarifications on our
                                        questions if her answer didn't seem to make sense to us."</p>
                                    <p>"Courtney was extremely welcoming and an amazing TA! She made her weekly office hours
                                        during our scheduled lab time one that was a place of comfort and growth. I appreciate how she
                                        tried to help us as much as she could to make sure we understood the concepts and she
                                        answered all of our questions."</p>
                                    <p>"- very helpful
                                        - explains very well and helps understands concepts
